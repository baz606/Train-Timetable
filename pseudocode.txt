Problem B - Google Code Jam 2008

Train Timetable -
    The main approach I am taking in solving this problem is using an event driven system where an event denotes when a train
    starts and ends its journey. For each departure and arrival, an event will be created which will be used to determine
    whether an extra train will be needed at that station.
