Problem B - Google Code Jam 2008

Train Timetable -
    The main approach I am taking in solving this problem is using an event driven system where an event denotes when a train
    starts and ends its journey. For each departure and arrival, an event will be created which will be used to determine
    whether an extra train will be needed at that station.

    Each event will have the following attributes:
    - Trip type: NA or NB
    - Time: in hours and minutes
    - Type of event: Departure or Arrival

    The program will also have the following variables:
    - Turnover time
    - Trains at A
    - Trains at B


// Main event loop
// Assuming all events are sorted by time. Arrival comes before Departure if the times are similar.
for event in eventList
    if event.type = DEPARTURE
        if event.tripType = NA
            if trainsAtA > 0
                trainsAtA--
            else
                trainsAtA++
        else if event.tripType = NB
            if transAtB > 0
                trainsAtB--
            else
                trainsAtB++
